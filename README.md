# CC_Foundations_Game
experiment with CC foundations

This exercise is designed to create reps in the areas necessary for basic CC workflow

- java coding basics
- TDD
- tickets or whatever it is that you call agile issues/tasks/whatever
- pull requests and branches as workflow
- working as a team especially sharing screens while you work
- naming conventions and standards as implicit workflow rules
- teamwork and velocity as mutually interdependent

The basic idea is that you cannot play this game without learning the basics of CC workflow as a side effect.

## Assumed Canonical "Standard" Workflow

No enterprise ever follows a perfect highest standard workflow, but we attempt to follow it at CC, so that any subset that an employer _**does**_ follow will be second nature to us, after a few dozen reps. 

_**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:**_ It is also assumed that this workflow will be extremely fast and easy, once it lives at the muscle memory level. Thus, this game is designed to push everything to that muscle memory level with the least possible effort.

Workflow:

- story
- ticket
- assignment of ticket
- create branch    
- create failing unit test
- write code that satisfies unit test
- push branch
- pull request
- code review
- merge to dev
